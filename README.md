# CT-Kidney
Image Classification model CNN vs VGG16 vs MobileNet

#Overview

The CT Kidney App is an AI-powered application that uses machine learning to detect tumors, stones, and cysts in the kidney by analyzing CT scan images. The app is trained on a large dataset of CT scan images that have been labeled by experienced radiologists.

#Model Comparison

The CT Kidney App uses a MobileNet model for image classification. MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that is well-suited for mobile devices and embedded systems. It is also faster and more efficient than other CNN models, such as CNN and VGG16.

#GUI

The CT Kidney App uses a GUI built with Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create web apps that are interactive, performant, and sharable.

#Prediction

The CT Kidney App uses the MobileNet model to predict the presence or absence of kidney tumors, stones, and cysts. The model is trained on a large dataset of CT scan images that have been labeled by experienced radiologists.

#Conclusion

The CT Kidney App is a promising new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way kidney disease is diagnosed and managed. By providing early and accurate detection of kidney abnormalities, the app can help to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of kidney disease on the healthcare system.

#How to Use

To use the CT Kidney App, simply clone this repository and run the app.py file. The app will open in a web browser.

To upload a CT scan image, click the "Upload Image" button and select the image file. The app will then analyze the image and generate a report.

The report will include the following information:

The presence or absence of kidney tumors, stones, and cysts
